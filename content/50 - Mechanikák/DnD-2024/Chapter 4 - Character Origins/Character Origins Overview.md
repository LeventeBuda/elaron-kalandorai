Every character’s story begins with their origin.  
An origin defines who you were before adventuring and what you are by nature.

A character’s origin has two components:
- **Background**
- **Species**

Together, these shape ability scores, proficiencies, traits, and narrative identity.

---

## Backgrounds

A **background** represents your character’s life before becoming an adventurer.

Each background provides:
- Ability Score increases
- Skill proficiencies
- Tool proficiency (if applicable)
- Starting equipment
- An **Origin Feat**

Backgrounds define training, social position, and experience.

---

### Ability Scores from Backgrounds

Your background grants bonuses to ability scores.

- Each background specifies which abilities increase
- These bonuses reflect prior training and lifestyle
- Backgrounds replace the older “racial ability score” system

This makes character origins more flexible and story-driven.

---

### Origin Feats

Each background grants a **feat** at 1st level.

- These feats represent practical training or innate talent
- Origin feats are balanced for early play
- They help define a character’s role from the start

Origin feats are a core part of character identity.

---

### Skills and Tools

Backgrounds grant:
- Skill proficiencies tied to experience
- Sometimes tool proficiencies
- Occasionally additional languages

These proficiencies ground the character in the world.

---

### Starting Equipment

Each background includes:
- Practical gear related to the character’s past
- Mundane items rather than combat-focused equipment

This reinforces narrative consistency.

---

## Species

A **species** represents your character’s physical and supernatural nature.

Species traits are innate and do not change with background.

---

### Species Traits

Each species defines:
- Creature type
- Size
- Walking speed
- Special traits unique to the species

Species traits are mostly defensive, sensory, or utility-focused.

---

### No Ability Score Increases from Species

In this system:
- Species do **not** grant ability score increases
- All ability score bonuses come from backgrounds

This separates biology from training.

---

## Combining Background and Species

A complete origin is formed by combining:
- One background
- One species

Together, they define:
- Early mechanical strengths
- Cultural and narrative hooks
- How the character fits into the world

---

## Using Older Backgrounds or Species

When adapting content from older books:
- Assign appropriate ability score increases
- Choose an Origin Feat that fits the concept
- Use the closest matching species traits

This keeps legacy content compatible.

---

## Origins in Play

Character origins influence:
- Roleplaying opportunities
- Skill use and social interaction
- How NPCs perceive the character

They are not just mechanics—they are story foundations.
