Trinkets are small, unusual items that characters may begin play with.  
They rarely have mechanical value, but they can inspire backstories, roleplaying, and plot hooks.

A trinket is a detail, not an advantage.

## Using Trinkets

A trinket can represent:
- A personal memory
- A mysterious origin
- A connection to the world
- A story yet to be told

Trinkets do not provide bonuses unless the DM decides otherwise.

---

## Choosing a Trinket

You may choose a trinket in one of two ways:
- Select one that fits your character
- Roll randomly on the Trinkets table

The DM may allow custom trinkets if they suit the campaign.

## Trinkets Table

Roll a d100 or choose an item.

| d100 | Trinket |
|-----|--------|
| 01 | A mummified goblin hand |
| 02 | A shard of crystal that faintly glows at night |
| 03 | A gold coin minted in an unknown land |
| 04 | A diary written in a language you don’t know |
| 05 | A brass ring that never tarnishes |
| 06 | A tiny mechanical bird that moves when wound |
| 07 | A faded map with a single location circled |
| 08 | A bone dice set carved with strange symbols |
| 09 | A sealed letter addressed to someone long dead |
| 10 | A key that fits no known lock |

The DM may expand or replace this table as desired.

## Trinkets and Story Hooks

A trinket can be used by the DM to:
- Introduce side quests
- Tie characters into the setting
- Reveal secrets over time

Players are encouraged to:
- Ask questions about their trinket
- Incorporate it into their backstory
- Let it evolve through play

---

## Losing or Replacing Trinkets

Trinkets can be lost, stolen, or destroyed.

If this happens:
- The loss may become part of the story
- The DM may introduce a replacement or consequence

Trinkets are story tools, not protected resources.
