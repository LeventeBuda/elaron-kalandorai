Not all campaigns begin at 1st level.  
Sometimes characters start with more experience, reflecting prior adventures or an established place in the world.

This section provides guidance for creating characters above 1st level.

## Starting Above 1st Level

When a campaign begins at a higher level:
- Characters gain all benefits of their chosen level
- This includes class features, hit points, spells, and proficiencies

The Dungeon Master determines the starting level for the campaign.

---

## Character Level

A character starting above 1st level:
- Has all class features gained at each level up to the starting level
- Uses the Proficiency Bonus appropriate to their total level
- Has the spellcasting capabilities listed for that level, if applicable

---

## Hit Points

For a character starting above 1st level:

- At 1st level, use the maximum value of the class’s Hit Die plus Constitution modifier
- For each additional level, determine hit points as if leveling up normally

The DM may choose whether:
- Players roll for hit points, or
- Players take the fixed value for each level

---

## Ability Score Improvements and Feats

If the character’s level includes one or more Ability Score Improvements:

- Apply all Ability Score Improvements gained up to that level
- Feats may be chosen instead of Ability Score Improvements, if allowed

All normal limits and prerequisites apply.

---

## Spellcasting

A character with spellcasting gains:
- Spell slots based on class and level
- Spells known or prepared appropriate to that level

For prepared spellcasters:
- Spells are prepared as if the character had advanced normally

Multiclass spellcasting follows the multiclassing rules.

---

## Starting Equipment

Characters starting above 1st level often begin with more equipment.

The Dungeon Master may allow:
- Starting equipment from class and background
- Additional gold
- Mundane or magical items

The amount and type of equipment are at the DM’s discretion.

---

## Magic Items

Starting characters might possess magic items.

The DM decides:
- Whether magic items are available
- How many items are allowed
- The rarity of those items

Magic items can help establish the tone and power level of the campaign.

---

## Wealth and Lifestyle

A higher-level character may begin with:
- More wealth
- A higher lifestyle
- Established resources or contacts

These details help place the character in the world.

---

## Party Balance

When starting at higher levels:
- All characters should start at the same level
- Equipment and resources should be roughly equivalent

This ensures fairness and cohesion within the party.

---

## Starting at Higher Levels and the Story

Beginning at a higher level implies a past filled with adventure.

The DM may encourage players to:
- Create shared backstories
- Define past accomplishments
- Establish relationships or reputations

These details enrich the campaign’s opening.
