As characters complete adventures, they gain experience and grow in power.  
Level advancement represents increased skill, resilience, and access to new abilities.

## Gaining a Level

Characters gain levels when the Dungeon Master decides they have earned enough experience.

Advancement can be based on:
- Experience points (XP)
- Milestones set by the DM

When a character gains a level, several elements of the character sheet change.

---

## Leveling Up

When you gain a level, follow these steps:

1. Increase your level by one  
2. Gain class features for the new level  
3. Increase hit points  
4. Adjust proficiency bonus if it changes  
5. Gain spellcasting benefits, if applicable  

All changes take effect immediately.

## Hit Points at Higher Levels

When you gain a level after 1st, you increase your hit points.

You can either:
- Roll your class’s Hit Die and add your Constitution modifier, or
- Take the fixed value listed for your class and add your Constitution modifier

You gain at least 1 hit point from leveling up.

---

## Class Features

Each class provides new features at specific levels.

Class features may include:
- New abilities
- Improvements to existing abilities
- Additional attacks
- Spellcasting progression

Some features enhance earlier abilities rather than adding new ones.

---

## Proficiency Bonus Advancement

Your Proficiency Bonus increases at certain levels.

When it increases:
- Update all rolls and values that use your Proficiency Bonus
- This includes attack rolls, ability checks, saving throws, and spell DCs

## Ability Score Improvement

At certain levels, your class grants an **Ability Score Improvement (ASI)**.

When you gain an ASI, you can:
- Increase one ability score by 2, or
- Increase two ability scores by 1 each, or
- Choose a feat instead

Ability scores cannot exceed 20 unless a rule states otherwise.

---

## Feats

A **feat** is a special feature that grants new capabilities.

Feats may:
- Improve ability scores
- Grant new actions or reactions

Some feats have prerequisites.

## Spellcasting Advancement

If your class has spellcasting, gaining a level may grant:
- Additional spell slots

Spellcasting progression is detailed in each class description.

---

## Multiclass Considerations

If you are multiclassing:
- Level advancement applies to the class you gain a level in
- Some benefits depend on your total character level
- Others depend on your level in a specific class

Multiclassing rules are covered in a separate section.

---

## Updating the Character Sheet

After leveling up:
- Update hit points
- Record new features
- Adjust spells and equipment as needed

Keeping your character sheet current is essential for smooth play.

---

## Level Advancement and the Story

Leveling up reflects growth within the story.

Advancement may represent:
- Training
- Hard-earned experience
- New insights or mastery

The DM may describe level gains narratively to reflect the character’s journey.
