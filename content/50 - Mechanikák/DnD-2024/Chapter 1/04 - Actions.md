This note explains how actions structure what a creature can do during play.  
Actions define how much a character or monster can accomplish at a given moment, especially during combat.

## What Is an Action?

When you do something other than moving or speaking briefly, you usually take an **action**.

Actions are most clearly defined during combat, but they also matter during:
- Social interaction
- Exploration
- Time-sensitive situations

In general, a creature can take **one action at a time**.

---

## Common Actions

The following are the most common actions available to creatures.

### Attack

You make one attack with a weapon or an Unarmed Strike.

Some features allow additional attacks as part of this action.

---

### Dash

You gain extra movement for the rest of your turn equal to your Speed.

---

### Disengage

Your movement does not provoke Opportunity Attacks for the rest of the turn.

---

### Dodge

Until the start of your next turn:
- Attack rolls against you have Disadvantage
- You make Dexterity saving throws with Advantage

You lose this benefit if:
- You are Incapacitated
- Your Speed is 0

---

### Help

You assist another creature.

You can:
- Grant Advantage on an ability check
- Grant Advantage on the next attack roll against a creature within reach

You can also use Help to administer first aid.

---

### Hide

You attempt to conceal yourself.

This usually requires a Dexterity (Stealth) check and appropriate circumstances.

---

### Influence

You attempt to alter a creature’s attitude or behavior.

This action usually involves:
- Charisma checks (Deception, Intimidation, Performance, or Persuasion)
- Wisdom (Animal Handling) checks

---

### Magic

You cast a spell, use a magic item, or activate a magical feature.

---

### Ready

You prepare an action to take later in response to a specific trigger.

When the trigger occurs:
- You can use your Reaction to perform the readied action

---

### Search

You attempt to notice something hidden or difficult to perceive.

This usually involves Wisdom checks such as:
- Perception
- Insight
- Medicine
- Survival

---

### Study

You analyze information or recall knowledge.

This usually involves Intelligence checks such as:
- Arcana
- History
- Investigation
- Nature
- Religion

---

### Utilize

You use a nonmagical object.

Examples include:
- Pulling a lever
- Opening a door
- Using equipment during combat

---

## Bonus Actions

Some abilities allow you to take an additional action called a **Bonus Action**.

Important rules:
- You can take a Bonus Action only if a rule explicitly allows it
- You can take only **one Bonus Action per turn**
- You choose when to take it unless the rule specifies timing

If you lose the ability to take actions, you also lose the ability to take Bonus Actions.

---

## Reactions

A **Reaction** is an instant response to a specific trigger.

Common examples include:
- Opportunity Attacks
- Certain spells and class features

Reaction rules:
- You can take only one Reaction per round
- You regain your Reaction at the start of your next turn
- A Reaction happens immediately after its trigger unless stated otherwise

If a Reaction interrupts another creature’s turn, that creature continues its turn afterward.

---

## One Thing at a Time

The action system enforces a simple principle:

You can take **only one action at a time**.

This rule prevents characters from:
- Performing multiple complex actions simultaneously
- Combining actions beyond what the rules allow

Class features, spells, and special abilities provide the exceptions to this rule.

---

## Improvised Actions

Not every possible action is listed in the rules.

If you describe an action not covered elsewhere:
- The DM decides whether it is possible
- The DM determines what kind of roll, if any, is required

Creativity is encouraged, as long as it respects the limits of the action system.
