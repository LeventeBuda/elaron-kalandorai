Feats represent special talents, training, or extraordinary abilities that set a character apart.  
They provide mechanical benefits and help define a character’s unique capabilities.

## What Is a Feat?

A **feat** is a special option that grants a character new abilities or enhances existing ones.

Feats can:
- Improve combat effectiveness
- Expand utility or versatility
- Reinforce a character’s narrative identity

Feats are optional but assumed to be part of standard play.

---

## Gaining Feats

Characters typically gain feats:
- When a rule or feature allows a feat choice
- In place of an Ability Score Improvement (ASI)
- From a background (Origin Feats)

Unless otherwise stated, a character can take a feat only once.

---

## Feats and Ability Score Improvements

When you gain an Ability Score Improvement:
- You may increase ability scores **or**
- You may choose one feat instead

Some feats include ability score increases as part of their benefits.

---

## Feat Categories

Feats are grouped into several categories for clarity.

---

### Origin Feats

- Gained at 1st level from a background
- Represent early training or natural aptitude
- Designed to be balanced for low-level characters

Origin feats help define a character’s starting role.

---

### General Feats

- Available to most characters
- Represent broad training or specialization
- Often improve skills, combat options, or resilience

These feats form the core selection.

---

### Fighting Style Feats

- Represent focused martial techniques
- Often interact with weapons, armor, or combat actions
- Typically suited for characters trained in battle

These feats reinforce specific combat approaches.

---

### Epic Boon Feats

- High-level feats intended for powerful characters
- Often gained after reaching maximum level
- Represent legendary or mythic abilities

Epic boons significantly alter a character’s capabilities.

---

## Prerequisites

Some feats have **prerequisites**.

A prerequisite may require:
- A minimum ability score
- Proficiency with certain equipment
- A specific class feature or level

You must meet all prerequisites to take a feat.

---

## Using Feats in Play

Feats:
- Are always active unless stated otherwise
- Stack with class and species features
- Are subject to DM interpretation and adjudication

Feats should enhance play without overshadowing class identity.

---

## Custom and Optional Feats

The DM may:
- Allow custom feats
- Restrict certain feats
- Introduce setting-specific feats

Any such changes should be agreed upon before play.
