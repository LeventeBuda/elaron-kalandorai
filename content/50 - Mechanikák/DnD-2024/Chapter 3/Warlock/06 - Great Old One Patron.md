Warlocks bound to Great Old Ones draw power from incomprehensible entities
that exist beyond mortal understanding. Their magic assaults the mind,
warps perception, and erodes the boundaries of sanity.

## Awakened Mind

Your patron grants you telepathic awareness.

- You can communicate telepathically with creatures you can see
- The creature does not need to share a language with you
- Communication is one-way unless the creature can reply telepathically

This feature allows silent manipulation and coordination.

---

## Entropic Ward

You twist probability around yourself.

- When a creature makes an attack roll against you
- You can use your Reaction to impose Disadvantage
- If the attack misses, you gain Advantage on your next attack

This reflects warped causality.

---

## Thought Shield

Your mind becomes alien and resistant.

- You gain resistance to psychic damage
- When a creature deals psychic damage to you
- That creature takes the same amount of damage

This punishes mental assaults.

---

## Create Thrall

You seize control of another creature’s will.

- As an action, you touch an incapacitated humanoid
- The creature becomes charmed by you indefinitely
- The effect ends if you use this feature again

This represents absolute mental domination.

---

## Great Old One Patron Philosophy

Great Old One warlocks wield power that defies comprehension.

They excel at:
- Psychic damage and control
- Mental manipulation
- Subtle, horrifying influence

Their magic does not rage or shine—it *whispers*.
