## Wild Magic Surge

Your spellcasting can unleash unpredictable effects.

- After you cast a sorcerer spell of 1st level or higher
- The DM may have you roll to trigger a Wild Magic Surge
- A random magical effect occurs

This feature defines the volatile nature of your power.

## Tides of Chaos

You can manipulate fate itself.

- You gain Advantage on one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw
- After you do so, the DM can trigger a Wild Magic Surge
- You regain the use of this feature when a surge occurs

This creates a push-and-pull between control and chaos.

## Bend Luck

You can alter fate with raw magic.

- When a creature you can see makes an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw
- You can spend Sorcery Points to add or subtract from the roll

This allows reactive manipulation of outcomes.

## Controlled Chaos

You gain limited influence over wild surges.

- When you roll on the Wild Magic Surge table
- You roll twice and choose which result applies

This reflects growing mastery over chaos.

## Spell Bombardment

Your spells can erupt with additional power.

- When you roll maximum damage on a damage die
- You can roll an additional damage die

This feature increases burst damage potential.

## Wild Magic Philosophy

Their power is untamed, dangerous—and spectacular.
