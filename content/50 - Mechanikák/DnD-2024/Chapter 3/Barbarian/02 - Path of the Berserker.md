The Path of the Berserker embodies unrestrained fury.  
Berserkers abandon defense and caution, focusing entirely on relentless offense and overwhelming aggression.

This path rewards risk-taking and endurance.

---

## Path Features

You gain the following features when you choose this path.

---

## Frenzy

Starting when you choose this path, you can drive your rage into a **frenzy**.

When you enter Rage, you can choose to frenzy. While frenzied:
- You can make one additional melee weapon attack on each of your turns
- This extra attack uses your Bonus Action

When your Rage ends:
- You gain one level of Exhaustion

Each time you frenzy, you suffer the consequences of pushing your body beyond its limits.

---

## Mindless Rage

Beginning at higher levels, your rage shields your mind.

While raging:
- You are immune to the Charmed condition
- You are immune to the Frightened condition

If you are already charmed or frightened when you enter Rage, the condition is suspended for the duration of the Rage.

---

## Intimidating Presence

Your fury becomes a weapon in its own right.

As an action:
- You can attempt to frighten a creature you can see
- The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become Frightened of you

The effect lasts until:
- The creature succeeds on its saving throw, or
- The duration ends as determined by the feature

This feature represents raw, overwhelming menace rather than subtle threat.

---

## Retaliation

At higher levels, your rage fuels brutal counterattacks.

When a creature within reach damages you:
- You can use your Reaction to make a melee weapon attack against that creature

This allows you to punish enemies for daring to strike you.

---

## Berserker Philosophy

Berserkers embrace pain and exhaustion as tools of war.

They excel when:
- Battles must end quickly
- Enemies rely on fear or control
- Sustained aggression overwhelms defenses

However, their power comes at a cost, requiring careful judgment about when to unleash their full fury.
