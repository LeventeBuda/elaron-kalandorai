The Astral Plane is a vast, silvery expanse that exists between worlds and realities.  
It serves as a connective medium linking the Material Plane to other planes of existence.

## Nature of the Astral Plane

The Astral Plane is:
- Timeless
- Weightless
- Largely empty, yet infinite in scope

Creatures in the Astral Plane do not age and do not require food or water.

---

## Gravity and Movement

- There is no natural gravity
- Creatures move by thought and intention
- Speed is often based on mental focus rather than physical ability

Objects and creatures can drift freely unless propelled.

---

## Time

Time does not flow normally in the Astral Plane.

- Creatures do not experience aging
- Long stays do not cause hunger or exhaustion
- Effects dependent on time may function differently

Time resumes normally when a creature leaves the plane.

---

## Color Pools

Color pools are portals connecting the Astral Plane to other planes.

- Each pool corresponds to a specific plane
- Entering a pool transports a creature to that plane
- Pools appear as shimmering, two-dimensional surfaces

Color pools are the primary means of planar travel from the Astral Plane.

## Astral Travelers

Common travelers include:
- Spellcasters using astral projection
- Planar entities
- Explorers and wanderers of the multiverse

Physical bodies may remain elsewhere while the astral form travels.

---

## Dangers of the Astral Plane

While largely empty, the Astral Plane is not safe.

- Hostile planar creatures may roam the expanse
- Losing direction can strand travelers
- Psychic hazards and planar phenomena may occur

Encounters are rare but often significant.

---

## The Astral Plane in Play

The Astral Plane is used for:
- Long-distance planar travel
- Mystical journeys
- High-level magical exploration

It is a place of transition rather than destination.
