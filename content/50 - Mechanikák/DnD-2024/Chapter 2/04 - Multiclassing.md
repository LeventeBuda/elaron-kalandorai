Multiclassing allows a character to gain levels in more than one class.  
This optional rule provides flexibility, but it comes with trade-offs.

---

## Multiclassing Basics

Instead of gaining a level in your current class, you can choose to gain a level in a new class.

When you do:
- You gain the features of the new class for that level
- You do not gain the starting equipment of the new class

The Dungeon Master decides whether multiclassing is allowed in the campaign.

---

## Prerequisites

To qualify for a new class, you must meet the ability score prerequisites for both:
- Your current class
- The class you want to enter

If you do not meet these prerequisites, you cannot multiclass into or out of that class.

---

## Class Features

When you gain a level in a new class:
- You gain the class features of that class for that level
- You do not gain features from lower levels of that class again

Class features stack unless a rule states otherwise.

---

## Proficiencies Gained

When you multiclass, you gain some of the new class’s proficiencies.

These typically include:
- Certain weapon proficiencies
- Certain armor proficiencies
- Tool proficiencies, if listed

You do not gain all the proficiencies a 1st-level character of that class would receive.

---

## Hit Points

When you gain a level in a new class:
- You gain hit points based on the Hit Die of that class
- Add your Constitution modifier as normal

This applies each time you gain a level, regardless of class.

---

## Spellcasting

Spellcasting follows special rules when multiclassing.

### Spell Slots

If you have spellcasting from more than one class:
- Determine your total spellcasting level
- Use the multiclass spell slot table

Some classes contribute partially to spellcasting progression.

---

### Spells Known and Prepared

- You know or prepare spells separately for each class
- Spellcasting ability depends on the class that grants the spell

A spell gained from one class counts as that class’s spell.

---

## Class-Specific Rules

Some classes have special multiclass rules.

Examples include:
- Extra Attack
- Unarmored Defense
- Channel Divinity

Always check individual class descriptions for restrictions or exceptions.

---

## Multiclassing and Ability Score Improvements

Ability Score Improvements are granted by class levels.

- If you gain a level in a class that grants an ASI, you receive it
- ASIs are not based on total character level

---

## Multiclassing Considerations

Multiclassing offers flexibility but can slow progression.

Consider:
- Delayed access to high-level features
- Reduced spell progression
- Synergy between classes

Multiclassing should support the character’s concept and story.

---

## Multiclassing and the Story

Multiclassing often reflects a change in focus or training.

Examples include:
- A fighter learning magic
- A rogue training as a ranger
- A cleric embracing martial combat

The DM may require narrative justification for multiclass choices.
