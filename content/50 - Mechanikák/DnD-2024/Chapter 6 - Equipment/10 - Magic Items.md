Magic items are objects imbued with supernatural power.  
They can enhance abilities, grant new powers, or alter the course of an adventure.

Magic items are not assumed parts of character progression and are awarded at the DM’s discretion.

## Attunement

Some magic items require **attunement**.

- A character can be attuned to a limited number of magic items
- Attunement requires spending time focusing on the item
- An item’s benefits apply only while attuned

Attunement prevents stacking too many powerful effects.

---

## Using Magic Items

Magic items function in various ways.

- Some are always active
- Others require an action, bonus action, or reaction
- Certain items have limited uses that recharge over time

Each item specifies how it is activated.

---

## Rarity

Magic items are categorized by rarity.

Common rarity categories include:
- Common
- Uncommon
- Rare
- Very Rare
- Legendary
- Artifact

Rarity reflects power, not availability.

---

## Charges and Recharge

Many magic items use charges.

- Charges are expended to activate abilities
- Items may regain charges at dawn, dusk, or after a rest
- Some items risk destruction if all charges are used

The item description specifies recharge rules.

---

## Identifying Magic Items

Magic items are not always immediately recognizable.

- The *Identify* spell reveals properties
- Experimentation may uncover partial effects
- Some items conceal curses or hidden traits

The DM determines how much information is revealed.

---

## Cursed Items

Some magic items are cursed.

- Curses activate upon attunement or use
- Removing a curse often requires magic
- Cursed items may resist being discarded

Curses add narrative tension and risk.

---

## Magic Items and Balance

Magic items are powerful tools.

- They can redefine character roles
- They may bypass obstacles or challenges
- The DM should consider party balance

Magic items should enhance the story, not replace it.

---

## Magic Items in the World

Magic items reflect history and culture.

- Items may have names, legends, or origins
- They are often unique or rare
- Possessing them may draw attention

A magic item can be a story hook as much as a reward.
