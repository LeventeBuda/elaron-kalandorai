## Welcome to Adventure

This story began 50 years ago, and you’re part of it.

In the 1970s, Gary Gygax and Dave Arneson created a game of make-believe that fused rules with storytelling. There had never been anything like it: a game in which each player made their own fantasy character and teamed up with friends to go on quests. One person served as the narrator and referee—the Dungeon Master—and did everything possible to challenge and delight the other players.

That game was the first version of **Dungeons & Dragons**, and you’re now reading its latest version.

Over the decades, millions of people have played D&D, and countless writers, game designers, and artists have shaped it through its many editions. When the current edition was released in 2014, the team was humbled by how much players loved it. This revised version is a salute to everyone: those who have played for years, those who contributed feedback, and those about to experience the joy of playing for the first time.

## Are You Ready to Embark on Fantasy Adventures?

Dungeons & Dragons invites you to play imaginary adventurers who delve into dungeons and other perilous locations together, face fearsome foes such as dragons, and build friendships forged amid fantastical dangers.

Fueled by imagination and rules, D&D invites you to adopt a fantasy persona—a mighty Fighter, a cunning Rogue, a faithful Cleric, a magical Wizard, or something else—and then solve problems, fight monsters, and visit wondrous places.

There’s no winning and losing in D&D the way those terms are usually understood. Together, you and your friends create an exciting story of adventurers who confront perils. Sometimes an adventurer might come to a tragic end. Even so, the other adventurers can search for powerful magic to revive their fallen comrade, or the player might create a new character to carry on.

If everyone has a good time and creates a memorable story, everyone wins.

## What You Need

To play D&D with one or more friends (a typical group has five people):

### Dungeon Master
One person takes on the role of the Dungeon Master (DM), the game’s lead storyteller and referee. The DM creates adventures, narrates what the characters experience, and plays the allies and enemies they encounter. Even while challenging the adventurers, the DM strives to delight the whole group.

### Players
Each player creates an adventurer who teams up with the others. Together, the group explores dangerous locations, solves puzzles, talks with characters, battles monsters, and discovers magic items and treasure—all while supporting each other’s fun.

### Additional Resources
You also need these resources, either in physical form or digitally:

- **Player’s Handbook** – the essential rules reference and guide to creating an adventurer  
- **Dungeon Master’s Guide** – guidance for creating and running adventures  
- **Monster Manual** – hundreds of creatures to populate adventures

## Learning by Watching

A great way to learn the basics of D&D is to watch others play. Online videos show the tremendous range of possibilities the game offers. As you watch, pay attention to how players help make the game fun for everyone in their group.

The only audience you need to entertain when playing D&D is yourself and your group.

## Worlds of Adventure

The worlds of D&D shimmer with magic, monsters, and spectacular adventure. These worlds exist within a multiverse and are connected to other planes of existence.

Some worlds are official settings—such as Greyhawk, Forgotten Realms, Dragonlance, Spelljammer, Planescape, Dark Sun, Eberron, and Ravenloft—while countless others are created by players themselves.

Your Dungeon Master may set a campaign in an established world or one entirely of their own creation. Because of this variety, always check with your DM about the setting of your upcoming adventures.
