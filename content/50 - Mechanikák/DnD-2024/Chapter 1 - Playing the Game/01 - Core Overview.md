# Playing the Game

This note covers the foundational concepts of how Dungeons & Dragons is played.  
It explains the roles at the table, the flow of play, and the core ideas that support the rules.

---

## Player or DM?

To play Dungeons & Dragons, one person takes on the role of the **Dungeon Master (DM)**, while the others play **adventurers**.  
A typical group consists of three to six players and one DM.

Each role contributes differently to the shared story.

---

## Being a Player

If you want to be one of the protagonists of the adventure, you are a player.

### Make a Character

Your character represents you in the fantasy world.  
They have abilities, skills, goals, and flaws that influence how they interact with the world.

After reading this chapter, you create your character using the rules in Chapter 2.

### Team Up

Your character works together with the other player characters as part of an adventuring party.

- Each character brings unique strengths
- Cooperation is more important than individual success
- Parties thrive when characters complement one another

### Venture Forth

The Dungeon Master presents locations, events, and challenges.  
You decide how your character responds.

The DM controls monsters and dangers, but is **not** your adversary.  
Their role is to guide the adventure as your character grows.

---

## Being the Dungeon Master

If you want to shape the world and challenge the players, you are the Dungeon Master.

### Build Adventures

You prepare the adventures the players experience.

- Adventures can be original
- Published adventures can be used
- Many campaigns combine both approaches

### Guide the Story

You describe environments, creatures, and events.

- Players choose what their characters attempt
- You determine outcomes using rules and judgment

### Adjudicate the Rules

You oversee how rules are applied.

- Resolve unclear situations
- Keep the game moving
- Ensure rules serve the group’s fun

## Rhythm of Play

D&D follows a repeating structure that applies to social interaction, exploration, and combat.

### The Basic Cycle

1. **The DM describes the scene**  
   Where the characters are and what surrounds them.

2. **The players describe their actions**  
   Characters act together or separately, depending on the situation.

3. **The DM narrates the results**  
   Outcomes may be automatic or determined by dice.

This cycle repeats continuously during play.

In combat and other structured situations, characters usually take turns.

---

## Exceptions Supersede General Rules

The game uses general rules to cover most situations.

If a specific rule contradicts a general rule, **the specific rule always takes precedence**.

Features, spells, and abilities often create such exceptions.

---

## An Ongoing Game

A **session** is one instance of play.

- A **one-shot** is a complete adventure played in a single session
- A **campaign** is a series of connected adventures

A helpful comparison:

- Campaign → TV series  
- Adventure → season  
- Session → episode  

Characters typically grow stronger and change over the course of a campaign.

---

## Dice

Dice introduce uncertainty and surprise into the game.  
They help determine success, failure, and unexpected outcomes.

---

## Dice Notation

Dice are written using the letter **d** followed by the number of sides.

Examples:

- d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20
- 1d6 means one six-sided die
- 3d8 + 5 means roll three d8s, add them together, then add 5

---

## Percentile Dice (d100)

Some rules use a d100.

Instead of a single 100-sided die, roll two ten-sided dice:

- One die represents the tens digit
- The other represents the ones digit
- A result of 0 and 0 represents 100

---

## Common Uses of Dice

Dice are commonly used to:

- Determine success or failure
- Calculate damage
- Generate random results
- Resolve percentage chances

---

## The Six Abilities

Every creature has six abilities that describe physical and mental traits.

- **Strength** – physical power
- **Dexterity** – agility and reflexes
- **Constitution** – health and endurance
- **Intelligence** – reasoning and memory
- **Wisdom** – perception and intuition
- **Charisma** – confidence and presence

---

## Ability Scores

Each ability has a score, usually ranging from 1 to 20.

- 10–11 represents the human average
- Higher scores indicate greater talent
- Some monsters exceed normal limits

Ability scores represent raw potential rather than training.

---

## Ability Modifiers

Each ability score provides a modifier used in many rolls.

- Low scores give negative modifiers
- Average scores give no modifier
- High scores give positive modifiers

Ability modifiers are applied whenever an ability influences an action.

---

# D20 Tests

This note explains how the core resolution mechanic of Dungeons & Dragons works.  
Whenever the outcome of an action is uncertain, the game uses a **D20 Test** to determine success or failure.

---

## What Is a D20 Test?

A **D20 Test** is a roll of a twenty-sided die (d20), modified by abilities, training, and circumstances.

D20 Tests are used when:
- An action could reasonably succeed or fail
- The outcome is narratively interesting
- Chance should influence the result

There are three kinds of D20 Tests:
- Ability Checks
- Saving Throws
- Attack Rolls
