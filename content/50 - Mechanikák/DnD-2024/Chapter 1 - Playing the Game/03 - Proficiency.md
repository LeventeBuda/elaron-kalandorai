## What Is Proficiency?

Proficiency represents formal training, practice, or specialized knowledge.

Characters and monsters are proficient in different things, such as:
- Skills
- Saving throws
- Weapons
- Tools

When a creature is proficient in something relevant to a roll, it adds its **Proficiency Bonus**.

---

## Proficiency Bonus

Every creature has a **Proficiency Bonus**.

- A character’s Proficiency Bonus increases with level
- A monster’s Proficiency Bonus is based on its Challenge Rating

### Proficiency Bonus by Level or CR

| Level / CR | Proficiency Bonus |
|-----------|------------------|
| 1–4 | +2 |
| 5–8 | +3 |
| 9–12 | +4 |
| 13–16 | +5 |

## When Proficiency Applies

You add your Proficiency Bonus when making a D20 Test that uses something you are proficient in.

Common cases include:
- Ability checks using a proficient skill
- Saving throws you are proficient in
- Attack rolls with weapons you are proficient with
- Spell attack rolls
- Calculating the saving throw DC of your spells

If you are **not** proficient, you make the roll without adding the bonus.

---

## The Bonus Doesn’t Stack

Your Proficiency Bonus can never be added more than once to the same roll or number.

Examples:
- If a rule allows a Strength (Athletics or Acrobatics) check, you add the bonus only once
- Being proficient in two relevant skills does not double the bonus

---

## Modifying the Proficiency Bonus

Some features modify how the Proficiency Bonus is applied.

- **Expertise** doubles the bonus for specific checks
- Other features may halve or otherwise modify it

The bonus:
- Can be multiplied only once
- Can be divided only once

---

## Skill Proficiencies

Most ability checks involve skills, which represent areas of focused training.

If you are proficient in a skill, add your Proficiency Bonus to ability checks that use that skill.

### Skill List

| Skill | Ability |
|------|--------|
| Acrobatics | Dexterity |
| Animal Handling | Wisdom |
| Arcana | Intelligence |

## Skills with Different Abilities

A skill is usually tied to a specific ability, but the DM may allow a different pairing if the situation warrants it.

Example:
- Using **Strength (Intimidation)** when relying on physical presence rather than words

In such cases:
- Roll using the chosen ability
- Add Proficiency Bonus if proficient in the skill

---

## Saving Throw Proficiencies

Saving throw proficiency allows a creature to add its Proficiency Bonus to saving throws using a specific ability.

- Each class grants proficiency in at least two saving throws
- Monsters list their saving throw proficiencies in their stat blocks

Saving throw proficiencies reflect a class’s training in resisting certain threats.

---

## Equipment Proficiencies

Characters gain proficiency with equipment from their class and background.

### Weapon Proficiency

- Anyone can wield a weapon
- If you are proficient, add your Proficiency Bonus to attack rolls with that weapon

### Tool Proficiency

If you are proficient with a tool:
- You can add your Proficiency Bonus to ability checks using that tool

If both a skill and a tool apply to the same check:
- You add the Proficiency Bonus once
- You have Advantage on the check

---

## Gaining Proficiency

Characters typically gain proficiencies from:
- Class
- Background
- Species
- Feats
- Class features

Proficiencies define what your character is trained to do well.
