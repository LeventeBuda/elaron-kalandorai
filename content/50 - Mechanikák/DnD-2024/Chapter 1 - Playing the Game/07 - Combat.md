Combat resolves moments of violent conflict between creatures.  
It is organized, turn-based, and measured in short spans of time called rounds.

---

## The Order of Combat

A typical combat encounter follows this sequence:

1. Determine surprise
2. Roll initiative
3. Take turns
4. End the round
5. Repeat until combat ends

---

## Surprise

A creature might be surprised if it is unaware of its enemies at the start of combat.

- The DM determines who is surprised
- A surprised creature:
  - Can’t move or take actions on its first turn
  - Can’t take Reactions until that turn ends

Surprise applies only at the beginning of combat.

---

## Initiative

Initiative determines the order of turns.

- Each creature rolls a Dexterity check
- Creatures act in order from highest to lowest result

If two creatures tie:
- The one with the higher Dexterity acts first
- If still tied, the DM decides

Initiative order remains the same for the entire combat.

---

## The Combat Round

A round represents approximately **6 seconds** in the game world.

During a round:
- Each creature takes one turn
- All turns together make up the round

---

## Turns

On your turn, you can do the following:

- Move up to your Speed
- Take one Action
- Take one Bonus Action (if available)
- Take free object interactions
- Speak briefly

You can take your Action and movement in any order.

---

## Movement

Movement is measured in feet.

- You can split your movement before and after actions
- Difficult terrain costs extra movement
- You can move through friendly creatures
- You can’t willingly move through hostile creatures’ space unless allowed

Leaving a hostile creature’s reach may provoke an Opportunity Attack.

---

## Opportunity Attacks

When a creature you can see moves out of your reach:
- You can use your Reaction to make one melee attack

Opportunity Attacks:
- Occur immediately before the creature leaves reach
- Do not occur if the creature Disengages
- Do not occur if the creature is teleported or moved without using its movement

---

## Actions in Combat

Most actions taken during combat are the same as those described in the Actions note.

Common combat actions include:
- Attack
- Dash
- Disengage
- Dodge
- Help
- Hide
- Ready
- Search
- Utilize
- Magic

---

## Making an Attack

An attack involves the following steps:

1. Choose a target
2. Determine modifiers
3. Resolve the attack roll
4. Roll damage if the attack hits

Some attacks require saving throws instead of attack rolls.

---

## Attack Rolls

An attack hits if the total equals or exceeds the target’s Armor Class (AC).

- A natural 20 always hits and is a critical hit
- A natural 1 always misses

---

## Ranged Attacks

Ranged attacks have a normal range and a long range.

- Attacks beyond normal range have Disadvantage
- Attacks beyond long range automatically miss

Ranged attacks made while a hostile creature is within reach have Disadvantage.

---

## Melee Attacks

Melee attacks target creatures within reach.

Unarmed strikes count as melee attacks.

---

## Cover

Cover makes a target harder to hit.

- Half cover: +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws
- Three-quarters cover: +5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws
- Total cover: can’t be targeted directly

---

## Hit Points

Hit points (HP) represent a combination of durability, luck, and will to fight.

- Damage reduces HP
- Healing restores HP
- When HP reaches 0, a creature may fall unconscious

---

## Temporary Hit Points

Temporary hit points:
- Absorb damage before normal HP
- Do not stack
- Are lost first when taking damage

They are not healing.

---

## Dropping to 0 Hit Points

When a creature drops to 0 HP:
- It falls unconscious
- It begins making death saving throws
- Damage may cause instant death

Player characters usually get a chance to survive.

---

## Ending Combat

Combat ends when:
- One side is defeated
- One side flees
- A truce is reached
- Circumstances change

The DM determines when combat is over and what happens next.

---

## Combat and the Story

Combat is part of the narrative.

Players and the DM are encouraged to:
- Describe actions vividly
- Explain outcomes narratively
- Let the results shape the story

Combat is not just about winning, but about what it means for the adventure.
