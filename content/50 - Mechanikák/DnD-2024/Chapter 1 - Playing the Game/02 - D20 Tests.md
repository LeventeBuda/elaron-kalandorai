This note explains how the core resolution mechanic of Dungeons & Dragons works.  
Whenever the outcome of an action is uncertain, the game uses a **D20 Test** to determine success or failure.

---

## What Is a D20 Test?

A **D20 Test** is a roll of a twenty-sided die (d20), modified by abilities, training, and circumstances.

D20 Tests are used when:
- An action could reasonably succeed or fail
- The outcome is narratively interesting
- Chance should influence the result

There are three kinds of D20 Tests:
- Ability Checks
- Saving Throws
- Attack Rolls

---

## Making a D20 Test

Every D20 Test follows the same basic steps.

### Step 1: Roll the Die

Roll one d20.

You generally want a **higher roll**.

If the roll has **Advantage** or **Disadvantage**, roll two d20s and keep only one result:
- Advantage → keep the higher result
- Disadvantage → keep the lower result

---

### Step 2: Add Modifiers

Add all applicable modifiers to the d20 roll.

Common modifiers include:
- The relevant **ability modifier**
- **Proficiency Bonus**, if applicable
- Circumstantial bonuses or penalties from features, spells, or conditions

---

### Step 3: Compare to a Target Number

If the total equals or exceeds the target number, the test succeeds.  
Otherwise, it fails.

The target number depends on the type of test:
- **Difficulty Class (DC)** for ability checks and saving throws
- **Armor Class (AC)** for attack rolls

The Dungeon Master determines the target number unless a rule specifies it.

---

## Ability Checks

An **ability check** represents a creature attempting to overcome a challenge using talent, training, or instinct.

Ability checks are used for actions that are not attacks and have a meaningful chance of failure.

Examples include:
- Forcing open a door
- Picking a lock
- Convincing a crowd
- Deciphering a coded message

---

### Naming Ability Checks

Ability checks are named after the ability modifier they use:
- Strength check
- Dexterity check
- Intelligence check
- Wisdom check
- Charisma check

Skills refine ability checks by representing specialized training.

---

### Difficulty Class (DC)

The **Difficulty Class** reflects how hard a task is.

Higher DCs represent more difficult tasks.

Common DC guidelines:

- Very easy tasks have low DCs
- Hard or dangerous tasks have high DCs
- Nearly impossible tasks have extremely high DCs

The DM sets the DC based on circumstances and narrative importance.

---

## Saving Throws

A **saving throw** represents an attempt to resist or avoid a harmful effect.

Saving throws are usually triggered by:
- Spells
- Traps
- Environmental hazards
- Monster abilities

Unlike ability checks, saving throws are rarely voluntary.

If you do not wish to resist an effect, you can choose to fail the saving throw.

---

### Saving Throw Abilities

Saving throws are named after the ability they use:
- Strength saving throw
- Dexterity saving throw
- Constitution saving throw
- Intelligence saving throw
- Wisdom saving throw
- Charisma saving throw

Each ability resists different kinds of threats.

---

### Saving Throw DC

The DC of a saving throw is determined by the effect that causes it.

For example:
- Spell saving throw DCs are based on the caster’s abilities
- Monster abilities specify their own save DCs

---

## Attack Rolls

An **attack roll** determines whether an attack hits a target.

An attack hits if the total equals or exceeds the target’s **Armor Class (AC)**.

Attack rolls most often occur in combat, but may also be used in contests or challenges, such as archery competitions.

---

### Ability Used for Attack Rolls

The ability modifier used depends on the type of attack:
- Strength for most melee weapon attacks
- Dexterity for ranged weapon attacks
- A spellcasting ability for spell attacks

Some features allow attacks to use a different ability than normal.

---

### Natural 20 and Natural 1

Special results occur when rolling certain numbers on the d20.

- A **natural 20** on an attack roll always hits and is a critical hit
- A **natural 1** on an attack roll always misses

These results ignore modifiers and Armor Class.

---

## Advantage and Disadvantage

Some circumstances improve or hinder a D20 Test.

- **Advantage** represents favorable conditions
- **Disadvantage** represents unfavorable conditions

When a roll has either:
- Roll two d20s
- Use the higher result for Advantage
- Use the lower result for Disadvantage

---

### They Don’t Stack

- Multiple sources of Advantage do not stack
- Multiple sources of Disadvantage do not stack
- If both apply, they cancel out and you roll one d20

This remains true regardless of how many sources are involved.

---

## Interpreting the Roll

Dice results are part of the story.

Unexpected outcomes can:
- Turn success into failure
- Allow unlikely victories
- Create dramatic or humorous moments

The DM and players are encouraged to interpret rolls narratively, describing *how* success or failure happens rather than just stating the result.
