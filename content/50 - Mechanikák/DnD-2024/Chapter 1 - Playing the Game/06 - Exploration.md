Exploration covers adventuring activities outside of combat, including travel, movement, perception, and interaction with the environment.

During exploration, the Dungeon Master describes the environment, and the players decide how their characters move through and interact with it.

---

## Vision and Light

Vision determines what creatures can see and how clearly they perceive their surroundings.

The level of light in an area affects visibility.

### Bright Light

Bright light allows creatures to see normally.

Most outdoor environments during the day are brightly lit.

---

### Dim Light

Dim light creates a lightly obscured area.

- Creatures have Disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight

Examples include:
- Twilight
- Sparse foliage
- Flickering torchlight

---

### Darkness

Darkness creates a heavily obscured area.

- Creatures are effectively Blinded when trying to see something in darkness

Without a special sense or light source, creatures cannot see in darkness.

---

## Obscured Areas

Some environmental effects block vision regardless of light level.

### Lightly Obscured

Examples:
- Patchy fog
- Moderate foliage
- Heavy rain

Effects:
- Disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight

---

### Heavily Obscured

Examples:
- Thick fog
- Dense smoke
- Complete darkness

Effects:
- Creatures are treated as Blinded with respect to what they cannot see

---

## Special Senses

Some creatures have senses that function differently from normal vision.

Examples include:
- Darkvision
- Blindsight
- Tremorsense
- Truesight

Each special sense describes:
- Its range
- What it can and cannot detect

---

## Traveling

While traveling, adventurers move through wilderness, roads, or dungeons over time.

The group chooses a **travel pace**, which affects how far they can move and what they can notice.

---

## Travel Pace

| Pace | Distance per Minute | Distance per Hour | Distance per Day |
|----|---------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Fast | 400 feet | 4 miles | 30 miles |
| Normal | 300 feet | 3 miles | 24 miles |
| Slow | 200 feet | 2 miles | 18 miles |

---

## Effects of Travel Pace

### Fast Pace

- Disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks
- Characters cannot use Stealth

---

### Normal Pace

- Characters can use Stealth, but with Disadvantage

---

### Slow Pace

- Advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks
- Characters can use Stealth normally

---

## Activities While Traveling

Characters can perform certain activities while traveling.

Common activities include:
- Navigating
- Tracking
- Foraging
- Mapping
- Keeping watch

The DM determines:
- Whether an activity is possible
- What checks are required
- How success or failure affects the journey

---

## Movement and Position

Exploration often involves precise movement, especially in dungeons.

The DM may track:
- Distances
- Positions
- Environmental hazards

Movement can be measured loosely or precisely, depending on the situation.

---

## Searching an Area

When characters search an area, the DM may call for:
- Wisdom (Perception) checks to notice details
- Intelligence (Investigation) checks to analyze clues

Searching takes time and may carry risks.

---

## Environmental Hazards

Exploration exposes characters to dangers such as:
- Extreme temperatures
- Rough terrain
- Traps
- Natural obstacles

Hazards may require:
- Ability checks
- Saving throws
- Resource management

---

## Time and Consequences

Time matters during exploration.

Spending time to:
- Search thoroughly
- Move cautiously
- Rest

may improve safety but allow threats to advance.

The DM uses time to create tension and meaningful choices.

---

## Exploration and the Story

Exploration is not only about movement, but discovery.

Through exploration, characters:
- Learn about the world
- Encounter new dangers
- Uncover secrets
- Shape future adventures
