This note explains how damage affects creatures and how healing restores their ability to fight and survive.

Damage and healing are most often relevant during combat, but they can occur in any dangerous situation.

---

## Damage

Damage represents physical injury, magical harm, or other effects that reduce a creature’s ability to continue fighting.

When a creature takes damage:
- Its hit points are reduced by the damage amount
- Damage applies immediately

---

## Damage Rolls

When an attack or effect deals damage:
- Roll the damage dice
- Add any applicable modifiers
- Apply the total to the target’s hit points

Some effects deal a fixed amount of damage instead of using dice.

---

## Critical Hits

When an attack roll results in a natural 20 and hits:
- The attack is a **critical hit**
- All damage dice rolled for the attack are rolled twice

Modifiers are added once, after rolling the dice.

---

## Damage Types

Different kinds of attacks and effects deal different types of damage.

Common damage types include:
- Acid
- Bludgeoning
- Cold
- Fire
- Force
- Lightning
- Necrotic
- Piercing
- Poison
- Psychic
- Radiant
- Slashing
- Thunder

Damage type matters mainly for resistances, immunities, and vulnerabilities.

---

## Resistance and Vulnerability

Some creatures are especially resilient or especially susceptible to certain damage types.

### Resistance

If a creature has resistance to a damage type:
- Damage of that type is halved

---

### Vulnerability

If a creature has vulnerability to a damage type:
- Damage of that type is doubled

---

### Multiple Modifiers

If multiple effects modify damage:
- Apply resistance and vulnerability after all other modifiers
- Resistance and vulnerability apply only once per damage instance

If a creature has both resistance and vulnerability to the same damage type:
- They cancel out, and damage is applied normally

---

## Immunity

If a creature is immune to a damage type:
- It takes no damage of that type

Immunity overrides resistance and vulnerability.

---

## Healing

Healing restores lost hit points.

When a creature regains hit points:
- Add the healing amount to its current hit points
- A creature’s hit points cannot exceed its hit point maximum

Healing has no effect on temporary hit points.

---

## Temporary Hit Points

Temporary hit points represent a buffer of protection.

Rules for temporary hit points:
- They are not healing
- They do not stack
- Only the highest amount applies
- They are lost before normal hit points

Temporary hit points can remain until depleted or removed by a rule.

---

## Dropping to 0 Hit Points

When a creature’s hit points drop to 0:
- It either dies or falls unconscious

The outcome depends on the creature and the circumstances.

---

## Instant Death

Massive damage can kill a creature instantly.

A creature dies outright if:
- Damage reduces it to 0 hit points, and
- Remaining damage equals or exceeds its hit point maximum

---

## Unconsciousness

A creature at 0 hit points that does not die:
- Falls unconscious
- Drops anything it is holding
- Is prone
- Cannot move or take actions
- Is unaware of its surroundings

---

## Death Saving Throws

An unconscious creature at 0 hit points makes death saving throws at the start of each of its turns.

Rules:
- Roll a d20
- A roll of 10 or higher is a success
- A roll of 9 or lower is a failure

Results:
- Three successes: the creature becomes stable
- Three failures: the creature dies
- A natural 20: the creature regains 1 hit point
- A natural 1: counts as two failures

---

## Stabilizing a Creature

A creature can be stabilized by:
- Succeeding on death saving throws
- Receiving healing
- A successful Wisdom (Medicine) check

A stable creature:
- Remains unconscious
- Stops making death saving throws
- Regains 1 hit point after 1d4 hours

---

## Knocking a Creature Out

When reducing a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack:
- The attacker can choose to knock the creature unconscious instead of killing it

The creature:
- Falls unconscious
- Is stable
- Wakes up after 1d4 hours

---

## Healing and the Story

Healing does not erase injuries narratively.

The DM may describe:
- Scars
- Exhaustion
- Lingering pain

Healing restores a creature’s ability to act, but consequences can remain part of the story.
