# Social Interaction

This note covers how characters interact with creatures through conversation, negotiation, and roleplaying.  
Social interaction blends player choice, roleplaying, and game mechanics.

---

## Roleplaying First

Social interaction begins with roleplaying.

Players describe:
- What their characters say
- How they say it
- What approach they take

Good roleplaying can influence outcomes before any dice are rolled.

Dice are used only when:
- The outcome is uncertain
- Success or failure has meaningful consequences

---

## NPC Attitudes

Nonplayer characters (NPCs) have attitudes that shape how they respond to the characters.

### Friendly

Friendly creatures:
- Want to help the characters
- Offer assistance or information willingly
- May take risks on the characters’ behalf

---

### Indifferent

Indifferent creatures:
- Have no strong feelings toward the characters
- Help only if it costs little or benefits them
- Can be persuaded or offended depending on the approach

---

### Hostile

Hostile creatures:
- Oppose the characters
- Refuse cooperation
- May resort to threats or violence

A creature’s attitude can change during an interaction.

---

## The Influence Action

The **Influence** action represents an attempt to change a creature’s behavior or attitude.

Common approaches include:
- **Deception** – lying or misleading
- **Intimidation** – threats or displays of power
- **Performance** – entertainment or emotional appeal
- **Persuasion** – honest argument and negotiation
- **Animal Handling** – influencing beasts

The DM decides:
- Which ability and skill apply
- Whether a roll is needed
- The Difficulty Class

---

## Ability Checks in Social Interaction

Most social interactions rely on **Charisma** ability checks.

However, other abilities may apply depending on the situation:
- Wisdom for reading emotions or intentions
- Intelligence for logical arguments or knowledge-based persuasion
- Strength or Dexterity for physical demonstrations meant to intimidate

The chosen ability should reflect *how* the character is influencing the creature.

---

## Degrees of Success

Success and failure in social interaction are rarely binary.

Possible outcomes include:
- Partial success
- Temporary cooperation
- A shift in attitude rather than immediate compliance

The DM may use degrees of success to reflect nuance and realism.

---

## Group Interactions

When multiple characters participate:
- One character usually leads the interaction
- Others can assist, granting Advantage

Conflicting approaches within the group can:
- Cancel advantages
- Worsen the NPC’s attitude
- Create new complications

---

## When Violence Is an Option

Some social interactions may escalate into combat.

Warning signs include:
- Threats
- Ultimatums
- Escalating hostility

The DM may allow characters a chance to de-escalate before combat begins.

---

## Player Agency and Consequences

Social interaction respects player choice.

- Characters are not mind-controlled by successful checks
- NPCs act according to their motivations and limits

Words have consequences:
- Promises can be remembered
- Insults can create lasting enemies
- Reputation can spread through the world

---

## Ending an Interaction

Social encounters usually end when:
- An agreement is reached
- One side withdraws
- Circumstances change
- Combat begins

The outcome of a social interaction can shape future adventures.
