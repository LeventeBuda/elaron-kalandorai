Spells represent magical knowledge learned, prepared, or granted to a character.  
How a character gains spells depends on their class features and other rules.

---

## Spellcasting Classes

Only characters with the Spellcasting or Pact Magic feature can normally gain spells.

Spellcasting classes gain spells through:
- Class features
- Level advancement
- Subclasses
- Feats or other special options

Each class defines how spells are learned and used.

---

## Learning Spells

Some classes **learn** spells permanently.

- Learned spells are always available to cast
- The number of spells known is limited
- Spells may be replaced when gaining levels, depending on the class

Examples include spontaneous spellcasters.

---

## Preparing Spells

Some classes **prepare** spells each day.

- Prepared spells are chosen from a class spell list
- Preparation usually occurs after a Long Rest
- The number of prepared spells is limited by class rules

Prepared spellcasters can change their available spells regularly.

---

## Spell Lists

Each class has a spell list.

- A spell must appear on your class’s spell list to be available
- Some features allow access to spells outside your list
- Multiclass characters use multiple spell lists

Spell lists define a class’s magical identity.

---

## Cantrips

Cantrips are simple spells that can be cast repeatedly.

- Casting a cantrip does not expend a spell slot
- Damage cantrips often scale with character level
- Cantrips are learned or granted by class features

Cantrips represent fundamental magical techniques.

## Gaining Spells When Leveling Up

When you gain a level in a spellcasting class:
- You may learn new spells
- You may gain additional spell slots
- You may replace certain spells, if allowed

The class description specifies how many spells you gain.

---

## Always-Prepared Spells

Some spells are always prepared.

- These spells do not count against your prepared spell limit
- They are usually granted by subclasses or features
- Always-prepared spells reflect specialized training

---

## Gaining Spells from Other Sources

Characters may gain spells through:
- Feats
- Magic items
- Racial or species traits
- Boons or blessings

These spells follow the rules of their source.

---

## Multiclass Spellcasting

Multiclass characters follow special rules.

- Spell slots may be shared across classes
- Spell preparation and learning remain separate
- Some features interact in limited ways

Multiclass spellcasting requires careful tracking.

---

## Losing or Replacing Spells

Spell availability can change.

- Some classes allow replacing spells when leveling up
- Spells may be lost through magical effects or story events
- The DM determines unusual cases

Spell changes should be handled carefully to preserve balance.
