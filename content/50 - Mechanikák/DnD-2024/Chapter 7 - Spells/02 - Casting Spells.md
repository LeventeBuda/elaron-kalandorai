Casting a spell follows a structured set of rules that determine how and when magic takes effect.  
Each spell specifies its own requirements, limitations, and results.

---

## Spell Slots

Spell slots represent magical energy used to cast spells.

- Casting a spell normally expends a spell slot of the spell’s level or higher
- Once expended, a slot cannot be used again until it is restored
- Spell slots are restored through rests or class features

Cantrips do not require spell slots.

---

## Spell Level

A spell’s level indicates its relative power.

- Spell level is not the same as character level
- Higher-level spells require higher-level spell slots
- Some spells gain additional effects when cast at higher levels

---

## Casting Time

A spell’s casting time determines how long it takes to cast.

Common casting times include:
- Action
- Bonus Action
- Reaction
- Minutes or longer

A spell with a Bonus Action casting time limits other spellcasting that turn.

---

## Range

A spell’s range determines how far its effects can reach.

- Some spells affect a creature or point within range
- Others affect only the caster
- Targets must be within range when the spell is cast

Line of sight and cover may affect spell targeting.

---

## Components

Most spells require components.

### Verbal (V)
- Spoken words of power
- The caster must be able to speak

### Somatic (S)
- Precise hand gestures
- The caster must have a free hand

### Material (M)
- Physical components specified by the spell
- A spellcasting focus may replace most material components
- Some components are consumed or have a gold cost

---

## Duration

A spell’s duration determines how long it lasts.

Common durations include:
- Instantaneous
- A number of rounds, minutes, or hours
- Until dispelled

Some spells require concentration to remain active.

---

## Concentration

Some spells require concentration.

- You can concentrate on only one spell at a time
- Taking damage may force a Constitution saving throw
- Failing the save ends the spell

Concentration ends if you cast another concentration spell.

---

## Spell Attack Rolls

Some spells require an attack roll.

- Use your spellcasting ability modifier
- Add your proficiency bonus
- The attack roll is compared to the target’s Armor Class

Critical hits may apply, depending on the spell.

---

## Saving Throws

Some spells force targets to make saving throws.

- The saving throw type is specified by the spell
- The save DC is determined by your spellcasting ability
- On a success, the target may take reduced or no effect

---

## Areas of Effect

Some spells affect an area.

Common area shapes include:
- Cone
- Cube
- Cylinder
- Line
- Sphere

Creatures in the area are affected according to the spell’s description.

---

## Casting Spells at Higher Levels

Many spells can be cast using a higher-level spell slot.

- This may increase damage, duration, or number of targets
- The spell description specifies the benefits

---

## Ritual Casting

Some spells have the ritual tag.

- Ritual spells can be cast without expending a spell slot
- Casting as a ritual takes additional time
- Only certain classes can cast rituals

---

## Interrupting a Spell

A spell can be interrupted if:
- The caster is incapacitated
- Concentration is broken
- A reaction spell interrupts the casting

The spell fails if interrupted before completion.

---

## Combining Magical Effects

Multiple magical effects can overlap.

- Identical effects do not stack
- The most potent effect applies
- Different effects may combine normally

The DM resolves conflicts between effects.

---

## Spellcasting and the World

Spellcasting is noticeable.

- Verbal and somatic components may draw attention
- Casting magic can have social consequences
- Magic often leaves visible or audible signs

How magic appears depends on the setting.
